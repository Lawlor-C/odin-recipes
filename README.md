A basic recipe website using only html knowledge and no styling as yet. Recipe pages will be of identical structuring to convey brand identity and familiarity (or essentially understanding how the formatting can be transferred)
There will be various sections, involving lists and images of the meal/dish and step-by-step of the recipe itself.
