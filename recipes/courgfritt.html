    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h4>For The Fritters</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium courgettes, grated</li>
            <li>½ tsp sea salt, plus extra to serve</li>
            <li>30g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>20g rice or cornflour</li>
            <li>2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds</li>
            <li>¼ tsp ground white pepper</li>
            <li>2 tsp mint leaves, finely chopped</li>
            <li>80g halloumi, grated</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 spring onions, finely sliced</li>
            <li>vegetable oil, for frying</li>
        </ul>
    <h4>For The Drizzle</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>½ tsp pul biber or other chilli flakes</li>
            <li>2 lemons, zested</li>
       </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>    
        <ol>
            <li>To make the chilli honey drizzle, warm the honey, 2 tbsp water, chilli flakes and lemon zest in a small pan until bubbling and syrupy, about 3 mins. Put the courgettes in a sieve and sprinkle over the salt. Allow to drain for 30 mins, then use your hands to squeeze out the liquid – you want them as dry as possible.</li>
            <li>Combine the flours, sesame seeds and pepper in a bowl. Add the mint, halloumi and courgette, and toss lightly to combine. Crack in the eggs and use a fork to stir them into the mixture along with the spring onions. Stir until you have a thick batter.</li>
            <li>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large, heavy-bottomed non-stick frying pan and swirl to coat the base. Add 2 heaped tbsp of the batter for each fritter, flattening them down with a spatula, and fry for a couple of minutes until golden. Flip them over and press down with the spatula, then fry for another few minutes until golden and cooked all the way through.</li> 
            <li>Drain on kitchen paper and season with a few flakes of sea salt. Drizzle with the chilli honey to serve.</li>            
        </ol>
